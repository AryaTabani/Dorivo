**Dorivo** is a comprehensive, scalable, and secure backend service built with Go for multi-tenant ordering applications, such as food delivery platforms, e-commerce stores, or restaurant management systems. It is designed with a clean 3-tier architecture and is fully containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This backend provides a complete set of features required for a modern ordering application:

* **Multi-Tenancy**: A core architectural feature allowing multiple businesses (tenants) to use the same application instance with completely isolated configurations, products, and orders.
* **Secure Authentication**: Standard JWT-based authentication for user registration, login, and secure access to protected routes. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
* **Full Product & Menu Management**:
    * Dynamic product searching and filtering based on categories, tags, price, and ratings.
    * Support for product customizations with option groups and add-ons (e.g., "Toppings," "Select a size").
    * Curated product lists for **Best Sellers**, **Promotions**, and **Chef's Recommendations**.
* **Complete Shopping Cart & Checkout System**:
    * Persistent shopping cart for each user.
    * Accurate price calculation, including product options and modifiers.
    * Support for promo codes and discounts.
    * Transactional order creation to ensure data integrity.
* **Order Management**: View order history with different statuses (Active, Completed, Cancelled), view full order details, cancel orders, and leave reviews for completed orders.
* **Comprehensive User Profile Management**:
    * Update user profile information (name, avatar, etc.).
    * Manage multiple delivery addresses and payment methods.
    * Granular notification settings.
    * Secure password change and account deletion.
* **Favorites System**: Allows users to save and view their favorite products.
* **Notification Center**: A system for storing and retrieving user-specific notifications triggered by application events (e.g., order status changes).
* **Tenant-Specific Content**: Each tenant can configure their own contact information and Help/FAQ sections.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The project follows a classic **3-Tier Architecture** to ensure a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

* **Controllers (Presentation Layer)**: Located in the `/controllers` directory. Responsible for handling HTTP requests, parsing input (payloads, URL parameters), and formatting JSON responses.
* **Services (Business Logic Layer)**: Located in the `/services` directory. Contains the core application logic, enforces business rules, performs calculations, and orchestrates data flow between controllers and repositories.
* **Repositories (Data Access Layer)**: Located in the `/repository` directory. This layer is responsible for all communication with the database. It abstracts the SQL queries and database logic from the rest of the application.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

* **Language**: **Go**
* **Web Framework**: **Gin** (for routing and HTTP handling)
* **Database**: **SQLite** (for simplicity and ease of setup)
* **Authentication**: **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
* **Password Hashing**: **Bcrypt**
* **Containerization**: **Docker & Docker Compose**

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Git** for cloning the repository.
* **Docker Desktop** installed and running on your machine.

### üê≥ Running with Docker (Recommended)

This is the simplest way to get the application and its database running.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AryaTabani/Dorivo.git
    cd Dorivo
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a **`.env`** file in the root of the project. The application requires a secret key for signing JWTs.
    ```env
    JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key-that-is-long-and-secure"
    ```
    *Note: The application will not run without this key.*

3.  **Build and run the container:**
    This single command will build the Docker image and start the application.
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`. The SQLite database file (`api.db`) will be created in your project directory, ensuring data persists even if the container is stopped.

### üõ†Ô∏è Running with a Local Go Environment (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run the application directly.

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    * Go (version 1.25.1 or higher) installed on your system.

2.  **Follow steps 1 and 2** from the Docker setup to clone the repo and create the `.env` file.

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.
